*Overview*

This project processes a list of integers from an input file and generates an output file with unique integers, sorted in ascending order. The project is designed to handle a variety of input cases, including lines with extra spaces, non-integer values, and multiple integers per line.

*Features*

* Reads integer values from an input file, ignoring invalid or non-integer data.
* Outputs a file with unique integers sorted in ascending order.
* Handles input variations such as whitespace, empty lines, and invalid entries.
* Efficient integer tracking using a Set to ensure uniqueness.

*Prerequisites*

* Node.js (v12 or higher)
* A terminal or command-line interface
* A text editor for modifying files (optional)

*Installation*

This section provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up the project on a local machine. It should include commands for cloning the repository and installing dependencies.

Example:
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unique-integers-project.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd unique-integers-project
Install dependencies (if any):
bash
Copy code
npm install
Repository Structure
Here, you describe the structure of the project folders and files. This helps users understand how the project is organized.

Example:
bash
Copy code
unique-integers-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sample_input_for_students/      # Directory containing sample input files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sample_results/                 # Directory where output files will be saved
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                            # Directory containing source code
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ uniqueInt.js                # Main application logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                       # Project documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json                    # Project configuration and dependencies
Usage
This section explains how to use the project. Include example commands and usage instructions, demonstrating how the project functions.

Example:
To process a sample input file and generate the output file, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
node src/uniqueInt.js sample_input_for_students/sample_01.txt
The output file will be created in the sample_results folder.

Running the Application
This section provides specific instructions on how to execute the application. It should clearly explain what commands to use and what to expect as output.

Example:
To run the application, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
node src/uniqueInt.js sample_input_for_students/sample_01.txt
The output will be saved in the sample_results folder as sample_01.txt_results.txt.

*Comparing Output Files*

You can use the diff command to compare the generated output with an expected result:

diff sample_results/sample_01.txt_results.txt expected_results/sample_01_expected.txt
